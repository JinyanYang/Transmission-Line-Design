# Transmission Line Design

This repository presents my work on transmission line design, including electrical, mechanical, and environmental considerations.  
The project was originally prepared as part of coursework and has been adapted into a GitHub research-style portfolio.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on designing a transmission line for practical operation:
- Selection of conductor type and parameters
- Mechanical design: tension, sag, tower loading
- Electrical analysis: resistance, inductance, capacitance, and reactance
- Environmental and safety considerations (temperature, wind, insulation)

## Key Features

1. Electrical Design
   - Per-unit length parameters (R, L, C)
   - Surge impedance, SIL (Surge Impedance Loading)

2. Mechanical Design
   - Conductor sag & tension calculations
   - Tower height considerations

3. Performance Analysis
   - Voltage regulation
   - Losses and efficiency
   - Thermal limits

4. Environmental Factors
   - Impact of wind and temperature
   - Clearance and safety margins

## Example Figures

*(Place relevant diagrams in the `figures/` folder and link them here)*

- Conductor cross-section  
- Tower structure illustration  
- Sag vs span length plot  
- Voltage regulation vs load curve  

## How to Use

1. Open `report/TransmissionLineDesign.pdf` for the full technical report.  
2. Explore the `figures/` folder for engineering diagrams.  
3. (Optional) Use the `calculations/` folder for numerical design models.  

## Notes

- The original document was part of coursework.  
- Sensitive information (student name/ID) should be anonymized before publishing.  
- This repository is intended as a portfolio demonstration of technical and analytical skills in power systems engineering.
